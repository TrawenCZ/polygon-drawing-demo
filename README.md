## Fourth iteration

Exercise focused on static methods, implementation and use of interfaces. 

1.  Create the `SimpleMath` class in the `cz.muni.fi.pb162.project.utils` package containing exclusively _static_ methods (so-called _utility class_)
    *   `double minX(Triangle triangle)` returns the minimum X coordinate.
    *   `double minY(Triangle triangle)` returns the minimum Y coordinate.
    *   Similarly for methods `maxX` and `maxY`.
    *   For the sake of simplicity, we can suppose that the triangle does not contain `null` elements (you need not to check it).

2.  Modify the `Triangle` and  Circle` classes, so they implement the `Measurable` interface.
    *   The height/width of a triangle is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (width) and y (height) coordinates of the vertices, respectively:
        ![width of objects](images/04a.png)
    *   Use static methods from the `SimpleMath` class.

3.  In the `utils` package, create the `Gauger` class, which allows you to "measure" objects and print information about their height and width. The class will contain two static overloaded `printMeasurement` methods:
    *   The first method takes any measurable object (i.e., any object implementing the `Measurable` interface) and
        *   prints _"Width: \<w\>"_, to the standard output where \<w\> is the width value,
        *   on the next line prints _"Height: \<h\>"_, where \<h\> is the height value.
    *   The second method will work especially for a triangle (object of type `Triangle`). It takes a triangle and
        *   prints triangle information to standard output, see `toString()` method,
        *   on the next line prints _"Width: \<w\>"_, to the standard output where \<w\> is again the width value,
        *   on the next line prints _"Height: \<h\>"_, where \<h\> is again the height value.
    *   Avoid repeating the code by calling the first variant of the method from the second variant. But be careful that the method won't call itself (there would be a loop ending with the `StackOverflowException`).

	    > When calling `printMeasurement`, it is necessary to cast the object to the interface. There will be so-called methods "trimming".

4.  The `Circle` class will implement the `Circular` interface - a circular shape expressed by its center and radius.
    The circle directly represents a circular shape, so there is no need to implement any new methods. However, it is necessary to add annotation `@Override`.

5.  In the `geometry` package, create the `Square` class. In our object abstraction, a square will not be expressed as four vertices (as in a triangle), but as a circular shape, the vertices of which can be calculated at any time from the center and radius (circumscribed circles).  The similarity between the circle and the square may sound a little strange, but you can also put "square" wheels on the car instead of "round" ones. The car will still go, it'll just rumble a bit more :-) Therefore:
    *   The class will implement the `Circular` interface
    *   The first constructor takes as input parameters the coordinates of the center of the circumscribed circle and the [**diameter**](https://i.redd.it/08brmyoaicq51.jpg) of the circumscribed circle.
    *   The second constructor will take a `Circular` object (containing the coordinates of the center and [**radius**](https://i.redd.it/08brmyoaicq51.jpg)) as an input parameter and will call the first constructor.
    *   The `Vertex2D getVertex(int index)` method returns the coordinates of the `index`-th vertex. The coordinates are calculated automatically from the center and the radius so that they represent a square rotated by 45Â°: At index 0 is the left vertex, 1 = lower vertex, 2 = right vertex and 3 = upper vertex. If the index is out of range, the method returns `null`.
    *   Don't forget the method `toString()` returning	_"Square: vertices=[ax, ay] [bx, by] [cx, cy] [dx, dy]"_
	
6.  In the `geometry` package, create the `Snowman` class:
    *   Our snowman consists of any **four** circular objects, i.e., circles, squares, etc. stacked on top of each other. However, the number can be easily changed at the compilation time (define it as a public constant). The snowman has no hands for simplicity. The "balls" of the snowman shrink upwards. 
    *   The constructor will take as its first parameter a parameter of type `Circular`, which represents the lower sphere.
	*   The second parameter of the constructor will be the reduction factor (real number of the range `(0..1>`). The upper parts of the snowman will shrink by this factor. If the input parameter is not in the required range, the named non-public constant `0.8` is used instead.
    *   The whole snowman is created in the constructor. It will consist of a circular object that we received. Above it will be circles (`Circle`) gradually decreasing by a given factor. 
	*   Don't be afraid to split the constructor code into smaller private methods.
    *   The `Circular[] getBalls()` method returns an array of all "show balls" from the lowest to the highest.

7. The demo creates a square with center `[0, 0]`, diameter of circle `100` and writes information about it to standard output.

8. Draw draws [a snowman whose bottom circle has a green square inscribed in it](https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/pb162/pb162-course-info/wikis/draw-images).
